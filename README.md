A context menu addition that will sort your files into their respective folder based on attributes.

To install:
1. Add script to C:/Scripts.
2. Add the .reg file to your registry. 

Modify script as you see fit.

I will be updating this to include things such as which attributes you want sorted, and more choices on where to sort them (in other folders), as well as sorting everything within the subfolders of the root directory you're sorting.
